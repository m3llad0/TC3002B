Automated dialogue systems, important applications of artificial intelligence, are struggled with by traditional systems to understand user emotions and provide empathetic feedback. Emotional intelligence technology is integrated into automated dialogue systems in this study, and a dialogue generation model with emotional intelligence is created through deep learning and natural language processing techniques. A wide range of emotions and specific pain signals can be detected and understood by the model in real time, enabling empathetic interaction to be provided by the system. By integrating the results of the study "Can artificial intelligence detect pain and express pain empathy?", the ability of the model to understand the subtle elements of pain empathy has been enhanced, setting higher standards for emotional intelligence dialogue systems. The project aims to provide theoretical understanding and practical suggestions to integrate advanced emotional intelligence capabilities into dialogue systems, thereby improving user experience and interaction quality.
