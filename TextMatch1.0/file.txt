A wireless sensor network (WSN) represents a decentralized assemblage of diminutive, energy-efficient, wireless devices dispersed throughout a physical setting to oversee various environmental parameters. The collated data from strategically positioned sensor nodes is relayed via multi-hop transmissions to destination nodes. WSNs present manifold advantages over alternative network configurations, such as heightened adaptability, economical deployment, and simplified setup. However, owing to the inherent resource limitations of WSNs, they confront a spectrum of challenges and concerns necessitating resolution to ensure dependable and secure data transfer. The constituent nodes of WSNs are particularly susceptible to diverse security breaches, including but not limited to the black hole attack, Denial of Service (DoS), and node compromise attack. Of these, the black hole attack poses a particularly grave peril to network integrity. Perpetrated by malicious nodes, this attack entails the deliberate discarding of both data and control packets, precluding their transmission to the intended recipients. To fortify the network against black hole attacks, the development of an effective Intrusion Detection Technique (IDT) for the detection of nefarious nodes is imperative. In this vein, the present study introduces a pioneering Fuzzy Logic-based Intrusion Detection System with Hidden Markov Model (FIDS-HMM) designed to discern malicious nodes and counteract black hole attacks. Furthermore, the incorporation of HMM in the proposed framework facilitates the monitoring of node energy levels to enhance the efficacy of malicious node detection. The practical realization of the proposed framework is executed via the NS2 simulator. Simulation outcomes corroborate the efficacy of the proposed FIDS-HMM protocol in detecting black hole attacks, while concurrently ameliorating Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput within the network.
