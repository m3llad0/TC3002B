We compared the print-to-speech properties and human performance characteristics of two artificial intelligence vision aids, Orcam MyEye 1 (a portable device) and Seeing AI (an iPhone and iPad application). The security of crops concerning quality and quantity is crucial to monitor disease in plants. Thus, recognition of plant disease is essential. The plant disease syndrome is noticeable in distinct parts of plants. Two individuals with measurable acuity and one with light perception were tested while blindfolded. We also tested performance with text of varying appearance in varying viewing conditions. To evaluate human performance, we asked the participants to use the devices to attempt 12 reading tasks similar to activities of daily living. We assessed the ranges of text attributes for which reading was possible, such as print size, contrast, and light level. We also assessed if individuals could complete tasks with the devices and measured accuracy and completion time. Participants also completed a survey concerning the two aids. Results: Both aids achieved greater than 95% accuracy in text recognition for flat, plain word documents and ranged from 13 to 57% accuracy for formatted text on curved surfaces. Both aids could read print sizes as small as 0.8M (20/40 Snellen equivalent, 40 cm viewing distance). Individuals successfully completed 71% and 55% (p = .114) of tasks while using Orcam MyEye 1 and Seeing AI, respectively. There was no significant difference in time to completion of tasks (p = .775). Individuals believed both aids would be helpful for daily activities. These techniques also benefit farmers in achieving expeditious and appropriate actions to avoid a reduction in the quality and quantity of crops. The application of these techniques in the recognition of disease can avert the disadvantage of origin by a factious selection of disease features, extraction of features, and boost the speed of technology and efficiency of research. Moreover, some of the future works in the classification of disease are also discussed.
