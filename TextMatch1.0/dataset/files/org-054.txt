Humans have certain social and emotional capabilities that help them to interact with other human beings, one such capability is to recognize the other human's emotions. This capability enhances human interactions to a great extent. As we move towards the age of increasing Human-Machine Interaction systems, we must strive to program our machines to achieve the so-called social and emotional capabilities algorithmically. A primary research frontier in emotion detection is recognizing it using facial images. Being able to recognize the emotions of a human being helps the machine adjust and tune itself to the human's needs and comfort. Emotion detection can be performed using various modalities such as video, audio, images, text, biometric information, etc. This study, explores the emerging trends in emotion recognition through facial images. Automated recognition of emotions of people has the potential to predict psychiatric illness or other latent mental health issues.
