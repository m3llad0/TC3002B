In a world where a major portion of the populace suffer with daily challenges of blindness, this pioneering project introduces a comprehensive smart support system designed to aid the needs of people who are visually impaired. This advanced system is ingeniously integrated into a pair of headphones, combining various state-of-the-art technologies such as cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Its primary goals encompass recognizing objects, accurately estimating distances between objects and users, deciphering captured signs and indications, and offering real-time location-based navigation and directions. This multifunctional blind assistance device is designed to empower users by enhancing their spatial awareness and providing them the tools they need to navigate travel securely and on their own. It represents a remarkable leap forward in refining the overall quality of life and mobility for the blind people.
