Dynamic Virtual Reality (VR) has revolutionized gaming and entertainment industries by providing immersive experiences that take users to new locations. This study presents a novel and exciting idea called virtual reality horror sports, which combines aspects of horror with sports in the VR medium. We provide a novel approach to developing adaptive VR horror games by combining player modeling approaches with an adaptive means-based system that learn about each player's individual fears and adjust the game's content accordingly. This work presents two significant advances: a unique method for determining a player's specific fears via game data and machine learning methods and an adaptive game system that employs agents to monitor players' terror experiences and restrict exposure to components that they find upsetting. Additional evidence from user studies and statistical significance testing suggests that our method may boost the stress and anxiety felt by gamers, resulting in rewarding gaming experience. When VR, horror and sports are all brought together, the outcome may compel and absorbing entertainment experience. Players will be immersed in a virtual environment that is both realistic and exciting. A dynamic virtual reality horror sports experience improved by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and player modeling provide a novel and comprehensive form of entertainment by fusing physical activity, customization and immersion in a single package. An endeavor of this kind has the potential to advance state of VR and artificial intelligence in gaming while also offering exciting and memorable adventures for gamers.
