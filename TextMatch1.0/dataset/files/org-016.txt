The revolution in digital computer technology that has made possible new and sophisticated imaging techniques may next influence the interpretation of radiologic images. In mammography, computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques have been used successfully to detect or to characterize abnormalities on digital images. Radiologists supplied with this information often perform better at mammographic detection or characterization tasks in observer studies than do unaided radiologists. This technology therefore could decrease errors in mammographic interpretation that continue to plague human observers.
