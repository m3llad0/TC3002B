There is a dearth of feasibility assessments regarding the use of large language models (LLMs) for responding to inquiries from autistic patients within a Chinese-language context. Despite Chinese being one of the most widely spoken languages globally, the predominant research focus on the application of these models in the medical field has been on English-speaking populations.
The effectiveness of LLM chatbots, specifically ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI) and ERNIE Bot (version 2.2.3; Baidu, Inc), one of the most advanced LLMs in China, in addressing inquiries from autistic individuals in a Chinese setting, is aimed to be assessed in this study.
Data was gathered from DXYâ€”a widely acknowledged, web-based medical consultation platform in China with a user base of over 100 million individuals. A total of 100 patient consultation samples were rigorously selected from January 2018 to August 2023, amounting to 239 questions extracted from publicly available autism-related documents on the platform. To maintain objectivity, both the original questions and responses were anonymized and randomized. Responses were assessed by an evaluation team of 3 chief physicians across 4 dimensions: relevance, accuracy, usefulness, and empathy. The team completed 717 evaluations. The best response was initially identified by the team, and a Likert scale with 5 response categories was then used to gauge the responses, each representing a distinct level of quality. Finally, the responses collected from different sources were compared.
