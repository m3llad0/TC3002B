In this article we present a model of adjustable moisture control for historical buildings. Proposed system is developed in a form of flexible IoT infrastructure in which a complex system of sensors is set to measure inside conditions of humidity and compare result to levels of groundwaters, rain and wind speed to manage drying system. Developed control model is using type-2 fuzzy logic reasoning to flexibly adjust decisions to the intensity of water absorption. In this way proposed model makes an innovative intelligent system for control of interior conditions in historical buildings. Developed system was installed and examined in an old brewery building. Research results show efficiency in dehumidification at lowest cost.
