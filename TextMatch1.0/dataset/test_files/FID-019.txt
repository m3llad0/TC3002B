One of the key elements expected to define the future of education is the use of artificial intelligence as a tool to enhance teaching and learning processes, as well as the work of teachers and administrators. Artificial intelligence and robotics present a variety of social, pedagogical, practical, ethical, and social justice issues and challenges as they bring changes to educational processes. After examining discussions and examples of AI use in education, especially in primary school settings, I will focus on the actual implications of this significant educational challenge. With these technological advancements, there is a clear risk of creating or exacerbating inequalities among social groups if equal access is not ensured. I will explore the potential for personalizing learning pathways by describing primary school initiatives designed to promote effective and collaborative communication skills, with the aim of recognizing, identifying, and preventing factors that impact learning disorders. Finally, drawing a parallel with the development of classical literacy (reading/writing), I will discuss the necessity of introducing artificial intelligence and robotics literacy courses for teachers, enabling these technologies to be more widely used across different age groups and grades.
