This project is inspired by turn-based strategy games, Final Fantasy Tactics, X-Com 2, and modern turn-based strategy games. This project is structured around the use of artificial intelligence for storytelling within strategy games. The focus of this project utilizes artificial intelligence in creating a quest generation system for storytelling. The resulting quest system creates new quests dynamically after communicating with an artificial intelligence allowing players to potentially experience an ever-expanding story from quests
