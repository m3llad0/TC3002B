Artificial Intelligence has become a significant tool in modern technology, enabling people to interact with machines through various methods. Individuals with visual impairments have trouble doing tasks because they are either blind or have poor vision. BVI stands for Blind and Visually Impaired. Solutions must also advance with technology to ensure that individuals can effectively navigate their surroundings and assist them in real-time navigation. The study conducts surveys on visually challenged individuals in the community and aims to assist them by providing smart gadgets to identify faces, colours, and objects.
